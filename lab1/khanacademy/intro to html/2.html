        <strong> Nobody’s born smart. </strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em> Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em> <br>
        There was a time when <strong> Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong> Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong> we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        <em> Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em> Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong> you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger.</strong><br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas </strong>that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
