        <h1>January Poem</h1>
        <p> Only the wrinkle <br>
            of a disappearing squirrel <br>
            breaks the snow stillness. <br>
            <br>
            The walker, swathed in wool,<br>
            lowers toward the prints left<br>
    by others, feet that lead to the village. </p>
